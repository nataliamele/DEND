<h4>Project 1</h4>
<h1>Data Modeling with Postgres</h1>

<p>In this project we performed analyses for startup Sparkify to understand what songs users are listening to.</p>

<p>Sprakify shared 3 types of JSON log files, which contain of user activity, songs, artists data. </p>
To acomplish this task we had to model STAR schema in Postgres DB and implement ETL pipeline to fetch data from logs.</p>
